Title: A simple Flash graphics device for R
Description:  This implements an R graphics device that produces
   ActionScript code that can be compiled into a Flash application
   and displayed in a Web browser or in a stand-alone application.
   The elements of the plot can also be programmatically manipulated
   at display time within the Flash application.
   The package also provides facilities for working with MXML files.
   We can programmatically manipulate and add content to these files and
   we can serialize R objects to MXML format.
