The goal here is to use R to draw a map in Flash and give it tooltips,
potentially animate it over time and so on.  We have done this for
SVG. So now we explore how we can do it in Flash. Unfortunately, we
have to draw the polygons ourselves and not use an R graphics device.
But see <omg:pk>RGraphicsDevice</omg:pk> for more information on this.
</para>


<para>
<r:code>
library(maps)
m = map('county', plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE, col = 'red')
</r:code>
</para>
<para>
We can use the Shape class in &prefuse; and 
<as:func>drawPolygon</as:func>.
To use this, we specify the coordinates
as a single array of successive x, y pairs.
</para>

<para>
We transform the coordinates to lie between 0 and 1.
<r:code>
r = range(m$x, na.rm = TRUE)
x = (m$x - r[1])/diff(r)
r = range(m$y, na.rm = TRUE)
y = (r[2] - m$y)/diff(r)
</r:code>

Next we separate the polygons by finding all the <r:na/>s and put the
contiguous values in between into their own arrays.  While we are at
this, we scale them for the Flex screen coordinates, i.e. between 0
and 800 and 0 and 600 on the horizontal and vertical axes
respectively.  These are values we select, but have to coordinate with
the mx:Application node in the MXML file.
<r:code>
id = cumsum(is.na(x))
id = id[ !is.na(x) ]
x = x[ !is.na(x) ]
y = y[ !is.na(y) ]
h = 600
w = 800

poly.arrays = list()
poly.arrays[seq(along = m$names)] = 
              by(data.frame(w*x + 100, h*y + 200), id, 
                  function(x) as.numeric(t(as.matrix(x))))[]
</r:code>
Next we write these 
<r:code>
library(R2JSON) # or our RJSONIO
x = toJSON(poly.arrays)
cat("public var polys : Array = ", x, file = "usaPolygons.as")
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
Now we generate some colors as if they were the election
results for the 24 elections for each of the counties.
(For the moment, we will use random values.
I haven't finished cleaning the data from the many elections.)
<r:code>
countyColors = lapply(seq(length = 24),
                       function(i) {
                          p = runif(length(m$names))
                          structure(sapply(substring(rgb(p, 0, 1 - p), 2), as.hexmode), class = "hexmode")
                       })

cat("public var countyColors : Array = ", toJSON(countyColors), ";", file = "usaColors.as")
</r:code>
</para>
