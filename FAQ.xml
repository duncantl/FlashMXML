When installing this package, how does R find the mxmlc compiler?
<a>
In the absence of any other information, the
configuration script will look for
the FlexSDK files in /usr/local, $HOME/Flex and $HOME/Projects/Animation/Flex
and terminate when it finds a lib/ directory and
lib/mxmcl.jar in one of those directories.
If you have not installed the FlexSDK in any of these locations,
you can specify the directory in which you did
via the --with-flex-dir flag, i.e.
<sh:code>
 R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-flex-dir=/my/directory' FlashMXML 
</sh:code>
You can also specify the command to invoke the mx compiler, i.e. mxmlc,
by setting the environment variable MXMLC

The FlexSDK expires after 60 days. What do I do then?
<a>
No, there is a free FlexSDK available at
<ulink url="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex3sdk"/>.
This is accessible from the main page
<ulink url="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/"/>
via the "Get the Free Flex 3.4 SDK"
(or whatever version is available).

I get warning messages from the MXML compiler 
saying something along the lines
<programlisting>
Warning: Source path entry, '/Users/duncan/Books/XMLTechnologies/Rpackages/FlashMXML/inst', is a subdirectory of source path entry, '/Users/duncan/Books/XMLTechnologies/Rpackages/FlashMXML'.

Should I be  concerned?

Are there any tools for debugging Flash in a browser?
<a>
<p>Use the debugging version of the Flash Player.
See the file Examples/debug.mxml for a way to test whether
you are using the debugging version.

You can use the 
<ulink url="http://www.sephiroth.it/firefox/flashtracer/">Firefox plugin FlashTracer</ulink>
to examine the output from trace() calls in your Flash/ActionScript code.
