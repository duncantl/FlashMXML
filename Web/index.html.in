<h1>FlashMXML</h1>
<p align=right><a href="@TAR_FILE@">@TAR_FILE@</a> (@DATE@)</p>

<p>
This package  provides
<ul>
  <li> various graphics devices for R that generate the plot as ActionScript
       code that can be displayed within a Flash application, and
  <li> tools to generate MXML content from R data
  <li> an R function for compiling MXML files to SWF binaries to be
      run by a Flash Player in a Web browser or stand-alone.
</ul>

One of the motivations is to be able to build stand-alone graphical
displays from within R  that use Flash to display the plots
and also to provide many GUI components.
</p>

<p>
This does not make R available to the Flash run-time engine.
The connection between R and Flash is when we generate the
Flash code from within R to later render the plots in Flash
quite separately.
</p>

<p>
The <code class="rfunc">mxmlDevice()</code> function creates an MXML application
document (and compiles it by default) containing the ActionScript
code to display the document. One can augment this MXML document
after the device has been closed to annotate the plot with interactive
components, event handlers, etc.
</p>
<p>
The <code class="rfunc">flash()</code> function implements
a device  that produces just the ActionScript code for the plot.
It generates code that creates ActionScript objects of different
classes such as RCircle, RLine, RText, RPolyline, RPolygon.
These can be redrawn, moved, transformed, etc. and each
has an RGContext object that represents the graphical parameters.
These can be changed and the object redrawn.
This device forms the basis of the <code class="rfunc">mxmlDevice()</code>
device which adds processing of the MXML file.
</p>

<p>
A third device <code class="rfunc">flashDevice</code> is
a simpler, more direct rendering of the R plot in Flash.
It generates the ActionScript code that draws the lines, circles,
polygons, etc. using simpler Sprite objects. The objects do not have
knowledge of the original R graphics parameters or the coordinates of
their path(s).
</p>


<p> This is a very early release that is intended as a prototype and
an example of how we might go about leveraging R's graphics from
Flash.  The graphics device works, but needs some work with respect to
fonts and positioning of text. I hope that others will take this and
experiment and develop better versions or feedback changes to me to
improve this version.  All of the code is in R as we use the <a
href="../RGraphicsDevice">RGraphicsDevice</a> package.  This makes it
quite easy to explore alternative implementations of different
aspects or write an entirely new device.

  <li>  <a href="annotation.pdf">Some examples</a> of post-processing
      the MXML/ActionScript code to provide interaction. Here
      we describe how to do this in ActionScript code.
  <dd>
      And some of the generated <a href="Examples">code</a>.
      View the swf files for running code, mxml files for the code
       generated from R.

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="annotatingInR.pdf">Annotation in R</a>
  <dd> This provides examples of how we can post-process the Flash
  plot in R, rather than ActionScript. Currently we  annotate
      the ActionScript code, but the generation of this code is in R.
      In the future, we may develop a generic annotation mechanism
     where   one annotates abstract descriptions of the plot elements.

  <li> Some notes/ideas on <a href="implementation.pdf">implementation</a>.

  <li> <a href="Rhtml">R help files</a>
  <dd> There are many more classes and functions that are not exported
  but should be of interest to anyone wanting to extend this package.

<h2>Related Packages</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the <a href="../RGraphicsDevice">RGraphicsDevice</a>
       provides a framework for implementing R graphics devices
      entirely within R, avoiding the need for C code.
  <li> the <a href="../SVGAnnotation">SVGAnnotation</a>   package
      uses SVG to display R graphics and provides many facilities
      for post-processing the regular R graphics to provide
      tooltips, interaction, animation and GUI components on the
      plots.
  <li> the  <a href="../RGraphicsDevice">RGraphicsDevice</a>
       contains an example R graphics device that generates JavaScript
      code for use in an HTML/JavaScript canvas element of an HTML document.
