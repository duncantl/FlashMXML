When we install this, we get a problem about the definition
of RGBStrict.
But in fact we get errors about simple class definitions, e.g.,
  setClass("Foo", contains = "character")

If we have RGraphicsDevice not import RAutoGenRunTime,
then things work okay.

Note that 
    setClass("XMLList", contains = "XMLInternalNode")
works fine.
